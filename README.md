CS50 Final Project
==================

CaeSar50 by Kevin Tremouille
-----------------------------

My final project is a web app, named "CaeSar50", used to encrypt and decrypta message with the famous Caesar cipher.
I used a Responsive Web Design for a better user experience (using the flexbox properties).

In the "Encrypt" page, you can encrypt your message, with the key of your choice. In the "Decrypt" page, you can decrypt this message.

The "About" page described the aim of this website, how the Caesar cipher works, and give some useful links related to CS50.

This website is of course created with HTML, CSS and Javascript.
The Caesar cipher function is created with Javascript.

Hope you will enjoy my final project.
